# Serverless Form API Service
An API portal that lets you programatically create/consume **form items** and **business contacts**. This project was created as a software engineering exercise in order to improve my experience with full-stack development, as well as familiarizing myself with creation, implementation, and deployment of APIs on the web.

This project was deployed using Vercel (for hosting) and Planetscale (as a database provider). However, as of March 2024, this project is no longer deployed on the web due to [Planetscale's descontinuation of their hobby plan](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever).

# Features
- Login/registration with support for authentication and authorization (via JWT)
- Creation, deletion, and regeneration of API keys
- Creation and deletion of applications (individual API services that belong to a user)
- API service with programatic creation and deletion of **form items** and **business contacts** (generic units of data)
